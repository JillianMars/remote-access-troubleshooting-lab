## Lab Overview

In this lab, I configured a Windows 10 built-in IKEv2 VPN profile and walked through a structured troubleshooting process after the connection failed.

The goal wasn’t just to “set up a VPN,” but to identify exactly **where** connectivity was breaking and validate the root cause using layered troubleshooting.

This lab focuses specifically on diagnosing a VPN connectivity issue related to **DNS resolution**.
